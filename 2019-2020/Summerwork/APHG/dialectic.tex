  ``How could anyone be more dear than my father? Would Chairman Mao let me put ponytails on him?'' (10) & This quotation provides a stark example of Ling's naiveté and thus creates the environment for a Bildungsroman, i.e. a coming-of-age story. By showcasing Ling's lack of knowledge about political ideologies, the story prepares for political strife as a main conflict.  \\
  \hline
  ``We used to recieve letters from overseas, too, but . . . after receiving a letter that had been opened, Mother became nervous and told father to stop writing to his friends. Why would anyone want to open our letters?'' (24) & Similar to the previous quotation, this passage displays Ling's lack of knowledge about established idealogical control; however, it does display a factor of curiosity in her thinking. By implanting this interest in the reasoning behind the status quo, the author could create a narrative in which this curiosity leads to conflict.  \\
  \hline
  ```Hopefully the mangoes will keep him busy for the night.' . . . I thought my parents did not like Comrade Li because he bought things from us. I was wrong'' (35). & This quotation finally introduces the antagonist of the story whilst hinting towards some kind of plan being set in motion. \\
  \hline
  ```They`re arresting an undercover enemy,' I said. My heart pounded. `What undercver enemy? Who is it?''' (50) & After introducting the main antagonist in the last chapter, the author finally implements a moment of hightened stakes and thus allows the plot to move forward in a more succinct manner than before. \\
  \hline
  ``To celebrate the victory of the Communist Revolution, many of the streets had been renamed, such as Big Liberation Road, Victory Road, Workers and Parents Road, and Red Five Stars Road'' (56). & It astonishes me that the propoganda of the Communist party permeated even the street names. The contiual use of them prompts a differentiation between the actions of the party and the party themselves. \\
